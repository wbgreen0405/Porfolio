<h2 align"left">The Problem</h2>

Each year over 1.3 million people die in traffic accidents and many more get seriously injured. Over 90% of these accidents happen in developing countries, where access to modern driver support technology is less accessible.

Enzo is an appealing, connected and fully voice-assisted heads-up display that gives the driver a safe and comfortable experience on an individual level. Being an affordable retrofit solution for any car, Consenz enables smart, interactive, and dynamic traffic planning. Not only for the selected few in a new, connected car but for the complete rolling car fleet.

With a few late exceptions, the user experience of voice assistance in cars has left a lot to desire. With the latest development in voice technology, not at least from the more and more frequent use of home assistants, the time is right for voice assistance in cars. With an intuitive voice assistance experience more like a normal conversation and with a broad, but correct, understanding of the driverâ€™s intents, many lives can be saved just by avoiding the need for physical contact with mobile phones while driving.


<h2 align"left">Objective & Motivation</h2> The objective of this project is to use ML/AI to make Enzo, the Consent driver assistant, an ideal driver assistant with the use of voice technology in combination with visual input from a Head-up Display (HUD).  
<h2 align"left">Role</h2> Task Leader for data collection and research. Managed a team of 20 members to search and pre-process open-source datasets. 
<h2 align"left">Data</h2> A total of 27 datasets and papers have been collected during the project. We identified seven datasets useful for the project.  Generated mixed dataset with clean speech and noise with different Speech to Noise Ratios (SNR) and ability to control total signal length. Utilized different techniques to clean speech and noise
<h2 align"left">Models</h2> Correlation analysis was used to check if there is any possible relationship and pattern among the features like triggers and symptoms. K-means clustering analysis was to see if certain segments could emerge from the dataset of users - segments based on similarities between the triggers and symptoms that the users in that particular group experienced. This would help Hashiona identify some dominant sects between the app users and health solutions could be tailored to the different requirements of these groups. 



<h2 align"left">The Project Outcomes </h2>

Using Machine Learning /AI to make Enzo, the Consenz driver assistant, towards an ideal driver assistant with the use of voice technology in combination with visual input from a Head-up Display (HUD). Since voice is the only way to communicate with Enzo, each driver individually should feel that speaking with Enzo and receiving instruction from him is intuitive and a good conversational experience. 

This means that Enzo should be able to adapt to different driver behaviors and preferences in everything from how often he interacts, the balance between voice and visual input, and how commands are being made, etc. The HUD comprises a System on Chip with capable processing power, 4 microphones, a loudspeaker, two cameras, and a screen for projection. The dedicated connectivity enables cloud computing. So, necessary learning and personalization could be a combination of edge and cloud. 

The accomplishments of this project include defining the project pipeline, building models for filtering driver assistant voice when a driver and the assistant speak simultaneously, and developing models for music and restaurant recommendation. In addition, the team built models for driver mood with personality classification, as well as developing a conversation agent that recognizes a wide range of intents and entities.
